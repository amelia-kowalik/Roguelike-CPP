## Game Context ⋆˚✿˖°

*Emma is a young woman who embarks on a journey through the nooks and crannies of a palace during a social event to find the room where the Prince is located. Meanwhile, she attacks every man she encounters because she can't restrain her ego from winning admirers.*

  

## Gameplay Plan ♡₊˚ 🦢・₊✧

- The journey begins in the ballroom.

- Physical fights are replaced with **dialogue**.

- Emma tries to **gain admirers**, while they try not to be won over.

- The game map consists of multiple floors and various rooms in the palace.

- Finding items that **facilitate manipulation** of victims is possible.

- Emma becomes stronger with each admirer gained **(EGO)**.

- Increasing her EGO increases the chances of winning over the Prince.

- The goal of the game is to reach the room where the **Prince** is and "defeat" him.

- Emma has 3 chances.

- **Permadeath** results in ultimate rejection (causes fainting).

## Enemies (Admirers) ₊˚⊹♡
_Men encountered by Emma during her journey._

- Have the same traits as Emma.

- Each has a weakness, which is one of Emma's traits.

- Do not have an inventory.

- Initially flee from Emma, fearing her. After being won over by Emma, they stand still.

#Types of admirers and their weaknesses:

- Manipulation - an admirer with this weakness is easier to defeat with more points added to this trait by Emma, also requires the universe's grace to display manipulation during dialogue selection. The same principle applies to the other weaknesses:

- Charm

- Charisma
 
- Intelligence 


# ♛✧˖ °Prince - Main Boss° ˖✧♛

- Can only be defeated after boosting EGO

- Located on the final level

- Very strong gentleman

# Battle Description (˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ )ﾉ• *₊°。(˶‾᷄ ⁻.‾᷅˵)ᵉʷ

- Emma starts the game with one EGO point, other stats have 1 point each.

- Gaining EGO allows adding points to traits.

- Initially encounters weak opponents (with the same stats as her).

- The outcome of battle partly depends on randomness (dice roll).

- Emma and the opponent have **33 life points**. Verbal clash continues until one has life<=0.

- During battle, dialogue options are randomly selected based on _traits_, and the player should choose those with more points. Selecting a dialogue option corresponding to the admirer's weakness causes Emma to deal more damage.

- The initial admirer's line indicates their weakness.

- If the player chooses a dialogue option where Emma is weak and the admirer is stronger, Emma's pride is hurt and she loses life points.

- Damage consists of **points added to traits by EGO+points from items+additional points for choosing weaknesses** 

- Dice roll serves as a damage multiplier. Emma's responses may not always be as intended, she may stutter or choke, indicating a _one_ on the die, or deliver lines perfectly, which corresponds to a _three_ on the die.

**Example attack:**
Selected dialogue option: MANIPULATION
Damage: (+5 points from stats, +2 points from items, +3 points for exploiting admirer's weakness) * dice roll (1 to 3) 

5+2+3 = 10 
10 * 3 = 30 damage

- Admirer's damage: **trait points * dice roll** (they have no inventory and don't care about Emma's weaknesses)

- If final damage turns out to be less than admirer's, Emma loses life points according to the opponent's attack
